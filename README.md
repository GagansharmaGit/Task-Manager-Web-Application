Task Management App Documentation
The Task Management App is a full-stack web application designed to help users organize and manage their tasks effectively. It provides a user-friendly interface for users to register, log in, add, edit, and delete tasks. The application ensures data security by implementing user authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and interacts with a MongoDB database to store task-related information.
